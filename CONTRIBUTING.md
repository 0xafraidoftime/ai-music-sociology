# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **AI & Music Sociology Research Project**!  
We welcome contributions from researchers, developers, and musicians who share our goal of exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, music, and society.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your feature branch:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
2. Make your changes in code, notebooks, or documentation.
3. Commit your changes with clear messages:
    ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: exploratory analysis of tempo vs sentiment"
4. Push to your branch and submit a Pull Request (PR):
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
5. Your PR will be reviewed as part of our peer review process (see below).

## Code Style & Standards

Follow PEP8 for Python code.

Use docstrings ("""Example""") for functions and classes.

Jupyter notebooks should:

Be modular (separate exploration vs analysis vs results).

Include clear markdown explanations between code cells.

Avoid unnecessary execution outputs (clear before committing)

## Research Methodology

Clearly describe datasets (real or synthetic) used in your notebooks.

Document any assumptions, limitations, or biases in the analysis.

Use reproducible workflows (e.g., fixed random seeds for simulations).

When adding clustering/ML methods, justify parameter choices (e.g., number of clusters).

## Ethical Considerations

Ensure all contributions respect artist rights and copyright law.

When scraping or using APIs (e.g., Spotify), follow their terms of service.

Be mindful of bias in datasets (e.g., genre, geography, or language).

Interpret results responsibly: avoid overgeneralizations about music and culture.

## Peer Review Process

All contributions will go through a two-step review:

Technical Review

Code runs without errors.

Meets style and reproducibility requirements.

## Research Review

Analysis aligns with the projectâ€™s sociological focus.

Interpretations are well-supported and ethically sound.

At least one reviewer from each domain (technical & sociological) should approve before merging.

## Submitting Issues

Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, request features, or suggest improvements.

Please tag issues as: bug, enhancement, research, or documentation.

## A Note for Musicians

If you are a musician or creative contributor:

You can share your insights about genre, mood, performance, or audience impact.

We encourage you to propose new ways to connect AI analysis with lived musical experience.

## Questions?

Open an issue or start a discussion in the repository.
I forward to building this project with you!
